        The Grace family moves from Brooklyn, New York, to their  <br> ancestral home in Henson, 
        Michigan, the Spiderwick Estate.  <br>  Helen makes the move with her 15-year-old 
        fraternal twin boys,  <br>  Jared and Simon, and her older daughter, Mallory. Shortly 
        after  <br>  moving to the Spiderwick Estate Jared discovers a boggart and  <br>  realizes 
        that magical creatures are real! The only one to believe  <br>  him is his great-aunt 
        Lucinda who implores Jared to find the  <br>  pages of her fatherâ€™s field guide to 
        magical creatures and protect  <br>  them from the murderous Ogre, Mulgarath.
